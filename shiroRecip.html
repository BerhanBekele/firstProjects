<p>Shiro is a staple vegetarian dish in Ethiopian cuisine. It’s basically a stew or curry made from ground dried chickpeas and various spices.  
    The chickpeas give the stew a beautiful texture and nutty flavor.  It’s very smooth and spreadable, almost the consistency of a thickened pureed soup.  
    Just mix and stir! </p>
<p>The flavors that enhance the Shiro are the classic Ethiopian ingredients- Berbere spice , 
    Niter Kibbe (Ethiopian spiced clarified butter), onions, tomatoes, and garlic. 
    Getting these ingredients singing in the right combination is the art of this dish.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Bring a heavy bottom stockpot to medium heat. Add pureed onions to the dry pan, and saute until they become dry and start to 
                    take on color- about 4-5 minutes. Add the oil and berbere spice. Saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Next add tomato and chopped garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes more.</li>
            
                <li>Now start whisking in about half of the chickpea flour. Gradually start to add about 1 cup of water. Whisk in the remaining 
                    chickpea flour and an additional 1 cup of water. Whisk until mixture is very smooth. Add remaining ½ cup of water if you prefer your shiro a little thinner.</li>
    
                <li>Heat until the shiro begins to pop (simmer). Then add the niter kibbeh, garlic powder, sugar, and salt to taste, stirring until combined.</li>
            
                <li>Simmer for about 5-10 minutes over low heat until the flavors combine and the oil separates slightly from the shiro.</li>
            
                <li>Serve with fresh injera.</li>
                            </ol>
        
                
                <h2>An aside</h2>
                <p>if anyone is at all interested- you can acquire Shiro Powder to make this dish as well. Shiro powder is different from chickpea flour/ besan.  
                It is actually a mixture of chickpea flour, spices, and seasonings.  It is a just-add-water type dish that is an even faster process to make.</p>
